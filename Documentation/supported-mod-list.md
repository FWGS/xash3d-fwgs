# List of mods which work on Linux and other non-Windows platforms without troubles
Most universal way to install and run mods - place your mod folder beside valve folder and launch engine with command-line arguments `-game <modfolder>`

Also, on some platforms you can see "Custom Game" menu in game where you can choose and run any installed mod.

For mappacks - place *.bsp files to **valve/custom/maps** folder, *.wad files to **valve/custom** and type **`map <mapname>`** cmd in game.
