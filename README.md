Xash3D FWGS is a fork of Xash3D Engine by Unkle Mike with extended features and crossplatform.

```
Xash3D is a game engine, aimed to provide compatibility with Half-Life Engine, 
as well as to give game developers well known workflow and extend it.

```

## Fork features
* HLSDK 2.4 support.
* Crossplatform: supported x86 and ARM on Windows/Linux/BSD/Android. ([see docs for more info](Documentation/ports.md))
* Modern compilers support: say no more to MSVC6.
* Better multiplayer support: multiple master servers, headless dedicated server.
* Mobility API: allows better game integration on mobile devices(vibration, touch controls)
* Different input methods: touch, gamepad and classic mouse & keyboard.
* TrueType font rendering, as a part of mainui_cpp.
* Multiple renderers support: OpenGL, GLESv1, GLESv2, Software.
* Voice support.
* External filesystem module like in GoldSrc engine.
* External vgui support module.
* PNG image format support.
* A set of small improvements, without broken compatibility.

## Planned fork features
* Virtual Reality support and game API.
* Vulkan renderer.

## Installation & Running
0) Get Xash3D FWGS binaries: you can use [testing](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/releases/tag/continuous) build or you can compile engine from source code.
1) Copy engine binaries to some directory.
2) Copy `valve` directory from [Half-Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/) to directory with engine binaries.
If your CPU is NOT x86 compatible or you're running 64-bit version of the engine, you may want to compile [Half-Life SDK](https://github.com/FWGS/hlsdk-portable).
This repository contains our fork of HLSDK and restored source code for some of the mods. Not all of them, of course.
You still needed to copy `valve` directory as all game resources located there.
3) Run the main executable (`xash3d.exe` or AppImage).

For additional info, run Xash3D with `-help` command line key.

## Build instructions
We are using Waf build system. If you have some Waf-related questions, I recommend you to read https://waf.io/book/

NOTE: NEVER USE GitHub's ZIP ARCHIVES. GitHub doesn't include external dependencies we're using!

### Prerequisites

If your CPU is x86 compatible, we are building 32-bit code by default. This was done to maintain compatibility with Steam releases of Half-Life and based on it's engine games.
Even if Xash3D FWGS does support targetting 64-bit, you can't load games without recompiling them from source code!

If your CPU is NOT x86 compatible or you decided build 64-bit version of engine, you may want to compile [Half-Life SDK](https://github.com/FWGS/hlsdk-portable).
This repository contains our fork of HLSDK and restored source code for some of the mods. Not all of them, of course.

#### Windows (Visual Studio)
* Install Visual Studio.
* Install latest [Python](https://python.org) **OR** run `cinst python.install` if you have Chocolatey.
* Install latest [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) **OR** run `cinst git.install` if you have Chocolatey.
* Download [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) development package for Visual Studio.
* Clone this repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs`.
* Make sure you have at least 12GB of free space to store all build-time dependencies: ~10GB for Visual Studio, 300 MB for Git, 100 MB for Python and other.

#### GNU/Linux
##### Debian/Ubuntu
* Enable i386 on your system, if you're compiling 32-bit engine on amd64. If not, skip this

`$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`
* Install development tools
  * For 32-bit engine on amd64: \
    `$ sudo apt install build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib python libsdl2-dev:i386 libfontconfig-dev:i386 libfreetype6-dev:i386`
  * For everything else: \
    `$ sudo apt install build-essential python libsdl2-dev libfontconfig-dev libfreetype6-dev`
* Clone this repostory:
`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs`

### Building
#### Windows (Visual Studio)
0) Open command line
1) Navigate to `xash3d-fwgs` directory.
2) Carefully examine which build options are available: `waf --help`
3) Configure build: `waf configure -T release --sdl2=c:/path/to/SDL2`
4) Compile: `waf build`
5) Install: `waf install --destdir=c:/path/to/any/output/directory`

#### Linux
If compiling 32-bit on amd64, you may need to supply `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig` prior to running configure.

0) Examine which build options are available: `./waf --help`
1) Configure build: `./waf configure -T release`
(You need to pass `-8` to compile 64-bit engine on 64-bit x86 processor)
2) Compile: `./waf build`
3) Install(optional): `./waf install --destdir=/path/to/any/output/directory`
