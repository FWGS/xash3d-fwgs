# Xash3D FWGS Security Policy

## Supported versions

Because we don't have clear release cycle yet, support is only provided to the
latest engine versions from `master` branch. You can use `host_ver` command in
console to fetch detailed info about the engine build.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, it can be reported
privately though `Security` tab on GitHub:
https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/security

Alternatively, you can report them publicly on the `Issues` tab:
https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/issues

In both cases, expect a reply within approximately a week.
