# Xash3D GameCube Port Plan

## Current status

The repository has a devkitPPC/libogc Waf target, GameCube platform sources,
GX renderer sources, static client/server stubs, and an end-to-end build script
at `scripts/build-gamecube.sh`. A PowerPC ELF and `OUT/bin/boot.dol` have been
produced locally. That proves a link and conversion step completed; it does not
prove the program boots or runs correctly.

The GameCube mappings in `3rdparty/library_suffix` are committed locally as
`663a601`, and parent commit `0f5cf35f` records the updated submodule pointer.
The submodule is clean. The submodule commit must still be pushed to an
accessible remote before a fresh clone outside this workspace can fetch it.

## Milestones

1. Reproducible clean build from a fresh checkout.
2. Boot in Dolphin with visible diagnostics and a controlled failure path.
3. Initialize video and controller input.
4. Mount SD/FAT storage and find `xash3d/valve`.
5. Reach the engine console or menu within the memory budget.
6. Load assets and a small map.
7. Validate on physical GameCube hardware.

## Strategy

- Keep platform work in `engine/platform/gamecube/` and use existing backend
  selectors in `common/`.
- Use Waf's `--gamecube` cross-compilation path and libogc rather than a second
  build system.
- Keep game code and renderer modules statically linked.
- Bring up GX output incrementally; do not assume desktop OpenGL behavior.
- Start with SD/FAT storage. Treat optical-disc support as a later milestone.
- Audit large fixed allocations and caches against the 24 MiB main-memory
  limit. ARAM is not a transparent substitute for main memory.
- Keep networking and audio stubbed only where their unsupported state is
  explicit and the engine handles the absence safely.

## Commands and evidence

Previously observed build command:

```sh
scripts/build-gamecube.sh
```

The existing `build/config.log` shows devkitPPC compilation with
`-D__GAMECUBE__` and `-DXASH_GAMECUBE=1`. The generated artifacts are not yet
runtime-tested.

On 2026-06-20, the harness ran:

```sh
scripts/ai-verify.sh
```

Result: Waf configured the GameCube target, compiled and linked
`build/engine/xash`, installed the static libraries and data under `OUT/`, and
generated non-empty `OUT/bin/xash` and `OUT/bin/boot.dol` artifacts. This
verifies the current local source tree builds; it does not verify runtime
behavior.

The GameCube launcher now calls `GCube_EarlyInit()` before `Host_Main`. It
routes stdout and stderr to libogc's Dolphin OSReport channel and emits
`Xash3D GameCube: bootstrap`, so startup logs and fatal errors are observable
before GX video initialization. A local runtime probe was not possible because
no Dolphin executable is installed in this environment.

Verification commands:

```sh
command -v dolphin-emu || command -v dolphin
scripts/ai-verify.sh
strings OUT/bin/boot.dol | grep 'Xash3D GameCube: bootstrap'
```

Result: no Dolphin executable was found; the complete GameCube build passed;
and the bootstrap marker is present in the generated DOL. Disassembly also
confirms `main` calls `GCube_EarlyInit` before `GCube_GetArgv` and `Host_Main`.
The build emitted an existing `SV_InitEdict` `-Wstringop-overflow` warning that
should be investigated separately from boot diagnostics.

On 2026-06-20, `OUT/bin/boot.dol` was run in Dolphin 2603a (Flatpak) in batch
mode with OSReport enabled. The first run reached engine initialization and
failed because the statically built `filesystem_stdio` archive was not linked
and registered with the GameCube module loader:

```text
Xash3D GameCube: bootstrap
Warning: SD card init failed, using DVD paths only
FS_LoadProgs: can't load filesystem library filesystem_stdio.so
```

The GameCube build now links `filesystem_stdio`, registers its `GetFSAPI` and
`CreateInterface` exports, and prefixes its ten engine-colliding implementation
symbols with `GCFS_`. The full build passed and a second Dolphin run reported:

```text
FS_LoadProgs: filesystem_stdio successfully loaded
Changing directory to  failed: No such device
```

This confirms the DOL boots and the filesystem module initializes. The current
Dolphin test profile has no SD Gecko/FAT volume, so `fatInitDefault()` fails and
the fallback root path collapses to an empty path. Dolphin logs are captured in
the ignored `.ai/logs/` directory.

## Next blocker

Provide a GameCube-accessible FAT or DVD volume containing `xash3d/valve`, then
rerun Dolphin and capture the first failure after filesystem initialization.
Also publish the `gamecube-platform` submodule branch to an accessible remote
so fresh clones can fetch the recorded commit.

## Next wake-up commands

```sh
git status --short
git -C 3rdparty/library_suffix diff --check
scripts/ai-verify.sh
command -v dolphin-emu || command -v dolphin
```
